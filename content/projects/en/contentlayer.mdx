Contentlayer started as a small project with just a Readme file to explain the product. We designed and developed a proper landing page as well as documentation pages, example pages and a blog â€“ using Contentlayer of course. To show how powerful Contentlayer is, we included severeal Stackblitz playgrounds.

With these pages in place, Contentlayer evolved **from being used in 210 projects in April 2022 to 5700+ projects in November 2023**.
